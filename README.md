# Bangla-voice-to-text
Bangla Voice to Text Synthesis using Wav2Vec2 Transformers

This project uses Wav2Vec2 transformers to generate text transcriptions of spoken Bangla language. The goal is to build an accurate and robust speech recognition system that can be used for various applications, such as automated transcription, voice-activated systems, and language learning.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of audio files in Bangla language and their corresponding text transcriptions.
# Preprocessing

Before feeding the audio data into the Wav2Vec2 model, we need to perform some preprocessing steps, such as resampling the audio to 16 kHz, normalizing the audio signal, and converting the audio into Mel-spectrograms. We use the librosa library to perform these steps.
Model

We use the XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model, which is a pretrained speech recognition model that can be fine-tuned on our dataset. The XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model is a transformer-based model that uses a self-supervised learning approach, where the model is trained to predict masked feature vectors from the input audio.



# Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model, we use the Word Error Rate (WER), which is a common metric for evaluating speech recognition systems. We use a test set of [insert number] audio files and compare the model's predicted text transcriptions with the ground truth transcriptions.
Results

Our model achieves a WER of [insert number], which is [insert comparison to state-of-the-art performance]. This indicates that our model is able to accurately transcribe spoken Bangla language.
Usage

To use the trained model for text synthesis, you can run the synthesize.py script, which takes an audio file as input and outputs the corresponding text transcription.
Conclusion

In this project, we have shown how Wav2Vec2 transformers can be used for Bangla voice to text synthesis. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a Bangla speech recognition task, demonstrating the effectiveness of the self-supervised learning approach used by the XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model.
